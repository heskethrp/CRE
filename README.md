## Assignments -

Submit pdf and Jupyter Notebook *yourname.jpnyb and/or ASPEN *yourname.bkp file (Remember make plots using excel)

### From the Syllabus:

### Computers:  Homework Assignments using Computers

a) Show how the problem was set up for the computer program using hand written equations.  This includes a diagram of the physical dimensions of the problem and the equations and known values that will be input into the program.

b) Show sample calculations (with units) for each spreadsheet or Python calculation on engineering paper. 

c) Do not printout raw data from data acquisition experiments.  A summary of the data in the form of a table and/or a graphical presentation of this data is sufficient unless otherwise requested from the professor.

d) For homework requiring Python, the following additional documents are required:
<ol>
i) A Jupyter Notebook file:  *yourname.ipnyb file. 

ii) A pdf file of the Jupyter Notebook. Only one pdf file must be submitted. (Paste output into a word document containing all tables and graphs required for a particular homework and convert to a pdf.  Use Adobe Acrobat to combine pdf files.

iii) A summary table of the iterations required for a solution and any trials required for the solution.  The solution should be identified in the pdf and boxed.  It should not just be a number on the printout.  If requested the program file may need to be uploaded on blackboard. 

iiv) Do not use an analytical solution as an aid to obtain a numerical solution to an identical problem.  The goal in this class is to compare the analytical solution to a numerical solution to gain an understanding of the capabilities of numerical solutions.
</ol>
e) For homework requiring ASPEN:  i) A summary table of the solution ii) a process flow diagram
iii) electronic file uploaded on blackboard or otherwise instructed by professor.

f) For homework requiring COMSOL:  i) handwritten setup of the problem showing geometry and equations ii) required graphs and tables iii) electronic *.mph file uploaded on blackboard or otherwise instructed by professor

### Electronic Submissions

All answers submitted electronically (e.g. Canvas) must be in a single pdf file for the entire assignment.  For example if there are 3 problems, then there will be 3 problem answers in the one pdf file that are placed in the order assigned.  Hand calculations can be scanned and inserted into the document.  All material including required graphs, must be placed in consecutive pages.  Beyond the initial electronic document, points will be subtracted for each electronic file that is required to be opened to see the work of the student.  If using MS word as the electronic document, convert to pdf before submitting.  Please do not upload a zip file since feedback can not be given using Canvas tools.
